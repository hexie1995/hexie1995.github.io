## Intro

I am a first-year PhD student at [Department of Mathematics at UNC Chapel Hill](https://math.unc.edu/) and my advisor is [Peter Mucha](http://mucha.web.unc.edu/). I am interested in Network analysis, Community Detection, Scientific computing and Machine learning.

## Fun fact

* I enjoy writing novels on AO3
* I am a huge fan of Stardew Valley and Fromsoft games
* I like anime and Japnaese food

Have questions or suggestions? 

Thanks for reading!
