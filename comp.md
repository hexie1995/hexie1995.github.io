## List of solutions
The solution set(dating back earliest to 2012 August) I have avaiable for the Methods comp are as follows:
* Phyiscs problems
* Homogenization problems
* Asymptotic root finding problems
* Complex problems
* Asymptotic Integral problems
* Higher order ODE problems
* Aysmptotic definition problems
* Eigenvalue problems and WKBs

## Instruction
* In order to get these solutions, please email me your solution to one complete comp methods exam. 
* You will than be emailed back the pdf solutions to these problems. 
* There is no garantee that these solutions are correct. They are based on discussion and inquiry from a lot of people.
